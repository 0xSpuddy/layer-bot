# Bridge Deposit Processing Time Tracking

## Overview
Successfully implemented tracking for bridge deposit processing times - measuring how long it takes from deposit to claim completion.

## Implementation Date
October 1, 2025

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (CSV Column)
- ✅ Added new column: `Claimed Timestamp`
- ✅ Position: After `Status` column
- ✅ Created migration script with automatic backup
- ✅ Migrated 141 existing deposits successfully

**Updated CSV Structure:**
```
Timestamp, Deposit ID, Sender, Recipient, Amount, Tip, Block Height, Query ID, Status, Claimed Timestamp, Query Data, Bridge Contract Address
```

### 2. Claim Timestamp Capture Logic

#### Modified: `src/layerbot/utils/query_layer.py`
- Updated `get_claimed_deposit_ids()` function to:
  - Capture system timestamp when deposit is first detected as claimed
  - Only set timestamp on first detection (prevents overwriting)
  - Handles both new 'Status' and legacy 'Claimed' columns
  - Logs when a new claim is detected with timestamp

**Key Logic:**
```python
# Captures timestamp only on first detection of claim
if not was_previously_completed and not row.get('Claimed Timestamp', '').strip():
    row['Claimed Timestamp'] = current_timestamp
    print(f"  → First time detected as claimed! Timestamp: {current_timestamp}")
```

### 3. CSV Setup Updates

#### Modified: `src/layerbot/bridge_info.py`
- Updated `setup_csv()` to include 'Claimed Timestamp' in headers
- Updated `save_deposit_to_csv()` to write empty timestamp for new deposits
- New deposits get filled when first detected as claimed

### 4. Processing Time Calculation

#### Modified: `app.py`
- Added `calculate_processing_time()` function
- Calculates hours from deposit timestamp to claimed timestamp
- Rounds to 2 decimal places for readability
- Handles missing or invalid timestamps gracefully

**Calculation:**
```python
time_diff = claimed_time - deposit_time
hours = time_diff.total_seconds() / 3600
```

### 5. Dashboard Statistics

#### Modified: `app.py`
- Calculates statistics for all completed deposits with timestamps:
  - **Count**: Number of deposits with processing times
  - **Average**: Mean processing time
  - **Median**: Median processing time  
  - **Min**: Fastest processing time
  - **Max**: Slowest processing time
- Passes statistics to template as `processing_stats`

#### Modified: `templates/deposits.html`
- Added "Processing Time Statistics" section showing:
  - Completed deposits count
  - Average, median, min, and max processing times
- Added processing time display in deposit details:
  - Shows "Claimed Timestamp" when available
  - Shows "Processing Time" in hours with highlighting
  - Only displays for deposits that have been claimed with timestamps

## How It Works

### Timestamp Capture Flow
1. **New Deposit Created**: 
   - CSV row created with empty `Claimed Timestamp`
   - Status set to 'in progress'

2. **Scanning for Claims**:
   - `get_claimed_deposit_ids()` runs periodically
   - Queries Layer chain for each deposit's claim status

3. **First Claim Detection**:
   - When `get-deposit-claimed` returns `true` for first time
   - System captures current timestamp in `Claimed Timestamp` column
   - Status updates to 'completed'
   - Logs: "→ First time detected as claimed! Timestamp: [time]"

4. **Subsequent Scans**:
   - Timestamp is preserved (not overwritten)
   - Status remains 'completed'

### Processing Time Calculation
1. **In app.py on page load**:
   - For each completed deposit with a claimed timestamp
   - Calculate: `claimed_time - deposit_time`
   - Convert to hours and round to 2 decimals
   - Store in `Processing Time (hours)` column

2. **Statistics Aggregation**:
   - Filter completed deposits with valid processing times
   - Calculate mean, median, min, max
   - Pass to dashboard template

### Dashboard Display
1. **Statistics Panel** (if any completed deposits have timestamps):
   - Shows aggregate metrics at the top
   - Provides quick overview of processing performance

2. **Individual Deposits** (in expandable details):
   - Shows claimed timestamp when available
   - Shows processing time in green with hours format
   - Only visible for deposits that have been claimed

## Migration Script

**Location:** `migrate_add_claimed_timestamp.py`

**Features:**
- Automatic backup with timestamp
- Validates CSV exists before migration
- Checks if column already exists (idempotent)
- Inserts column in correct position
- Preserves all existing data

**Usage:**
```bash
source env/bin/activate
python migrate_add_claimed_timestamp.py
```

## Important Notes

### Timestamp Accuracy
- The claimed timestamp represents when the system **first detected** the claim
- It is NOT the exact on-chain claim time (no direct method available)
- Accuracy depends on scan frequency
- More frequent scans = more accurate timestamps

### Historical Data
- Existing completed deposits have empty claimed timestamps
- This is expected - we can't retroactively determine when they were claimed
- Only new claims (detected after this update) will have timestamps
- Processing time statistics will grow as new deposits complete

### Data Integrity
- Migration created backup: `bridge_deposits.csv.backup_20251001_102733`
- Original data preserved
- No existing functionality broken
- Backward compatible with old 'Claimed' column

## Verification Steps

1. **Check CSV structure:**
   ```bash
   head -1 bridge_deposits.csv
   ```
   Should show: `...,Status,Claimed Timestamp,Query Data,...`

2. **Test claim detection:**
   ```bash
   source env/bin/activate
   python -m layerbot.utils.query_layer
   ```
   Watch for: "→ First time detected as claimed! Timestamp: ..."

3. **View dashboard:**
   - Start Flask app: `python app.py`
   - Check for "Processing Time Statistics" section
   - Expand completed deposit to see processing time

4. **Test new deposit flow:**
   - Add a new deposit
   - Wait for it to be claimed
   - Verify timestamp is captured
   - Check processing time is calculated

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements:
1. **Visual Charts**: Add processing time trend chart
2. **Alerts**: Notify if processing time exceeds threshold
3. **Export**: CSV export of processing time data
4. **Percentiles**: Show 95th, 99th percentile processing times
5. **By Contract**: Separate statistics per bridge contract

### API Endpoints (Future):
- `/api/processing-stats` - Get processing time statistics
- `/api/processing-history` - Get historical processing times
- `/api/deposit/{id}/processing-time` - Get specific deposit timing
